MissingOutputException in rule move_left in file /scratch/kotryna/Giedrius/2016_sRNALactis/data_prep/Snakefile, line 98:
Job 58  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
output/FivePoints_1/selectedMoved.bam.bai
Removing output files of failed job move_left since they might be corrupted:
output/FivePoints_1/selectedMoved.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
